## Models and Methodology

### Models

Logistic Regression: A statistical model used for binary classification to predict the probability of a binary outcome.
Random Forest: An ensemble learning method using multiple decision trees to improve the model's accuracy and robustness.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): A supervised machine learning model for classification that works by finding the hyperplane that best separates the data into different classes.

### Methodology

### Data Preprocessing:
Handling Missing Values: Identify and deal with missing values by removing or imputing the missing data.
Normalization: Normalize numerical features to ensure all values are in a similar scale.
Encoding Categorical Features: Convert categorical features into numerical format using one-hot encoding or label encoding.

### Feature Engineering:
Feature Selection: Select the most relevant features from the dataset to reduce dimensionality and improve model performance.
Feature Extraction: Create new features by transforming existing ones, such as using statistical methods to extract patterns from raw data.


### Model Training:
Split Data: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model Fitting: Train the models using the training data and evaluate them using the testing data.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Tune the hyperparameters of the models using grid search or random search to improve performance.

### Model Evaluation:
Accuracy: Measure the proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions.
Precision: The ratio of true positive predictions to all positive predictions.
Recall: The ratio of true positive predictions to all actual positives.
F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between them.
